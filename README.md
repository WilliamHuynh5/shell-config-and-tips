ZSH is an extended version of Bash, providing the same functionality of Bash, but also with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes.

Some notable improvements over Bash include:
- Faster autocompletion
- Tab completion behaves like a drop down 
- Spelling correction

## What is Oh-My-ZSH? ðŸ§
